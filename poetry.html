                    And after a long time without contact
                    I noticed
                    Just like you did ages before.
                    I’m grateful to you cutting me off
                    I wouldn’t have enjoyed you seeing more of my momentary insanity that only with drugs is brought to peace.
                    What in my delusions were moments of love and moments of pure hatred
                    Has turned into a distant memory just like a flashback.
                    I drank the Elixir of love
                    As I believed for a while
                    Or was it a trap like all who are around me believe?
                    I’d rather believe in the former, it brings me a brief peace
                    However, saddened I am by the needle I take every month, that seems to be in conflict with stated Elixir.

                    Maybe even they were blinded
                    The ego is/was so big that it disabled them from seeing within this reality.
                    I write with hatred
                    But this is not what my soul wants
                    I will definetely notice a way of accepting such realization.

                    I guess so
                    Why would we be enemies.

                    I mean, how we look here,
                    We’re the same anyway, doesn’t matter.
                    I was being myself with my goofy sense of humor and he just called me to deploy something to someone.
                    I don’t like to make deliveries.

                    He was in a lawyer like room,
                    And I knew who to expect but he wasn’t that person.
                    Anyway. Back to the pat on the back,
                    He showed me love and told me good night,

                    DO IT.
                    Later I found out that he had done it before
                    To my sister.

                    Until a new one appears.
                    The first and the second knew it all
                    The second knew more.
                    He would call himself Judas
                    And I’d call myself Jesus.
