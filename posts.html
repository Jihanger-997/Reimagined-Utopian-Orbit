                    <p>
                    I wonder if I should even be complaining about that, but wow it's a lot to take in!
                    <br><br>
                    I've been fixing my life in such a rapid manner. I quit smoking, started exercising, meditating and praying on a daily basis, have been much more dedicated with university and everything in general. I even met the love of my life, something I believed wouldn't happen until I was in my 30s, but it did. But I've been feeling much more. I shouldn't be complaining about this, I asked for it. To be able to feel more myself and those that I love.
                    <br><br>
                    Cigarettes were really keeping my void filled, and now this void must be filled with what I actually need. Nothing? Maybe not, maybe near nothing. What is driving me forward is the desire to show to myself I can achieve my dreams and goals, and that I can win the game of life, without sacrificing my integrity and morals. My relationship also drives me forward, it's something that in the present is real, unlike my dreams that I have yet to achieve.

                    <h3><big>17/01/2022</big> - When everything falls into place.</h3>
                    <p>
                    I would never have imagined I’d find a light, a light so bright that it would make me want to be the best version of myself. It didn’t happen out of nowhere though. I had to work on myself, break my negative beliefs, start going after my dreams, even if one step at a time. I also had to allow myself to love, and most important, be loved. Yet, I would never have imagined this light would be better than my dreams and idealizations (I also had to stop idealizing, take notes). This “light”, as I name, is so nourishing to my soul. There’s these two verses from “I Found”, by Amber Run:
                    <br><br>
                    “And I’ll use you as a focal point
                    <br><br>
                    So I don’t lose sight of what I want”
                    <br><br>
                    They made so much sense to me when I found (pun not intended) this song when I found (now the pun was intended) the light. It’s a feeling of wanting to enable the future to happen, and she makes sure I don’t worry about it. A feeling that allows our goals to be shared, and she always assures me that we have time for it. I am so grateful for having such a compassionate and loving, strong yet sweet, dedicated and smart, and bright Light in my life. Thank you for existing.
                    </p>

                    <h3><big>23/10/2021</big> - An understanding about life. Well, partially.</h3>
                    <p>
                    Like, life is weird. I still don’t completely comprehend it. I know more answers will comme as I grow older, and a friend made me realize I am much wiser than before. As much as I’m anxious for the future, I can’t be thinking about it. I have to think about the present moment. It seems like my thoughts are finally defining my reality, as much as it is nice, it’s a bit of a big responsibility right now. Maybe I need to start taking physical responsobility as well, meaning actual world responsibilites. The mystical (it’s not that mystical trust me) responsibility I chose to take is already there, I just need to balance out both of them. Maybe when I have a family I will be able to share it with my wife, who knows what will happen. I have my principles now, found myself in my religion, and all is as well as it can be. I have finally learned how to love, and as much as I don’t like to think it at times, it was part of my fault that I didn’t understand the importance of culture, specifically my origin’s. I will probably learn about my other half’s culture, though I hate to say it, some parts of it I really don’t like. In the end I just partly understand it, and I live in another place right now, divided between reality and cosmic.

                    Remember to always stay true to yourself, let your feelings flow, understand that you can be wrong at times and that there is nothing wrong with accepting the blame. Just take it in a healthy way you know.

                    <h3><big>24/09/2021</big> - Do you believe in destiny/predetermination?</h3>
                    <p>
                    Good day to you, I hope your days become brighter with every new cycle. Today I have a weird topic to talk about, which some people might not understand completely.
                    <br><br>
                    Have you ever felt like everything you do throughout your life, is supposed to bring you somewhere? If you don’t, let me put it in another perspective. Have you ever felt like everything you’ve done, brought you here, to the present moment, as it is and as it should be? Going through my old music files, I realized this. Some people like to call it destiny or predestination, meaning you don’t really have any choices and everything will happen as it is supposed to be. Others say you choose what you do in life, but do you really?
                    <br><br>
                    No matter your perspective on life, if it’s evolution or intelligent creation, it all goes down to the same focus. Humans had to evolve to a point, going through harshness and difficulties, to reach its supposed peak - I just think we hindered our physical evolution, not that we are at our peak. If your belief is that of a superior power, and that there are consequences for your wrong actions, think a bit about it. We do everything according to His plan.
                    <br><br>
                    Where do I want to get with this? I’ve always listened to electronic music, since I was in the womb. I slowly drifted to a more trancey genre, until I got into the Psytrance culture on my early adult age. I was shown the way to it, nobody told me “listen to this, listen to that”. The more and more I downloaded music (which were usually in music packs), the more I saw and enjoyed the trance genre.
                    <br><br>
                    My time with the psytrance culture taught me a lot, it was short, but packed a powerful punch in me. It allowed me to start growing from a child to an adult, as hard as it may seem to be. I was thrown to the bottom of the pit, but I got out of it so much stronger (and going back to believing that there’s an afterlife).
                    <br><br>
                    I hope someday, if you still haven’t forgiven yourself for your wrong doings to other people, that you do. Shame and guilt are the worse feelings you can have, they cause fear. If you’re afraid, you don’t function properly. So don’t let anyone or any institution cause shame and guilt in you, you knew what had to be done, so that you can evolve to a better person, and the best version of you in the present moment.
